# web-programming

Welcome to my first website repository! This project was developed as an assignment for my Web Programming course, taught by Professor Rodrigo Martins Pagliares. Here, I've created some simple but engaging personal websites to learn about web development using WordPress and, later on, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
