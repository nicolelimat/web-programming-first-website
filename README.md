# web-programming-first-website

Welcome to my first website repository! This project was developed as an assignment for my Web Programming course, taught by Professor Rodrigo Martins Pagliares. 

Here, I've created some simple but engaging personal websites to learn about web development. This website showcases my initial foray into web development using WordPress. It served as my first assignment for the course and provided valuable insights into building websites with a content management system

**My Second Website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)**:
  For my second assignment, I recreated the content and design of the first website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This allowed me to delve into the fundamentals of web development and gain a deeper understanding of the technologies powering modern websites.
