# web-programming/first-website

Welcome to my very first website repository! This project was developed as an assignment for my Web Programming course, taught by Professor Rodrigo Martins Pagliares. My first website is a simple personal webpage created using WordPress. It showcases some of my basic web development skills and provides information about me, my interests, and my projects.
